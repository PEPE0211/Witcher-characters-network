Witcher Universe Character Network Analysis


Welcome to the Witcher Universe Character Network Analysis repository! In this project, we explore the rich and intricate world of Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher book series through the lens of network analysis. Dive into the interconnected relationships, alliances, and conflicts among your favorite Witcher characters like Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, and more.

Key Features:

Web Scraping: We used wiki fandom site to extract the names of all the characters in all the books

Character Interaction Network: We've created a network representation of characters from the Witcher books, capturing their interactions, associations, and affiliations.

Graph Algorithms: Utilizing Python's powerful network analysis libraries, we apply graph algorithms to uncover intriguing insights about the Witcher universe.

Visualizations: Visualize the character network to see the intricate web of connections and relationships within the Witcher world.

Data Analysis: Our analysis goes beyond mere visualization; we delve into the data to uncover patterns, central characters, and factions within the Witcher universe.
